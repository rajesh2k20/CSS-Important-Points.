/* The box model has the following rules:

The dimensions of a block element are calculated by width, height, padding, borders, and margin.
If no height is specified, a block element will be as high as the content it contains, plus padding.
If no width is specified, a non-floated block element will expand to fit the width of its parent minus padding.
The height of an element is calculated by the content’s height.
The width of an element is calculated by the content’s width.
By default, padding and border are not part of the width and height of an element. */
